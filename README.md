# weather-forecast
Build a weather dashboard that will allow users to see the current weather and the 5 day forecast for a desired city.

## Description
The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Data is retrieved from the OpenWeather API based on the user's input in the search field.  

The user's search history is stored in the browser, so a user can click on a recently searched city and see the current and future conditions without searching again. 

## User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
